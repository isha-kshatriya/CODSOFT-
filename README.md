# CODSOFT- First of all, I would like to thank the Codsoft firm for providing me this wonderful opportunity to showcase my talents via internships and well-thought tasks provided to us.

I have used the Tkinter library in Python to create a simple yet insightful GUI. To set the screen, I have made use of several methods such as geometry(), minsize(), maxsize(), etc. I have also used some widgets and their attributes provided by the Tkinter library to design a pleasing GUI.

For the logic part of the code, I have used various concepts of Python such as functions, loops, if-else statements, exception handling, etc. Additionally, I have utilized the math, random, and string modules. To understand the code, one must have a basic understanding of Python, Tkinter, and the math and string modules in Python.
